Part 1: Directions on using Webstorm

Download the program from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
Download GitHub from https://git-scm.com/downloads

Create a GitHub account
Connect your GitHub account to Webstorm
  - Hit the hamburger icon in the top left
  - Navigate to File -> Settings
  - Select Version Control
  - Select Git
  - Enter the file location of the GitHub you downloaded
  - Input GitHub login information into Webstorm
  - Done!

Create a repository in GitHub
 - Click the "New" button in the top left on Github.com
 - Enter your repository name
 - Adjust any settings as you see fit (ensure it is public)
 - Done!

How to open your repository on WebStorm
 - Navigate to where your current repository name is (top left of screen)
 - Click dropdown, then click "Clone Repository"
 - Hit "GitHub" on the left side of the new window
 - If your GitHub account was properly linked, any repositories stored in your linked GitHub account will be displayed here
 - Click on the desired repository and Clone
 - Done!

How to save your changes
 - When done editing files navigate to the commit tab on the left side of the screen, located just under the file icon (Shortcut: Alt + 0)
 - Check all files you want to save (or in other terms: commit)
 - Write a detailed description of what you did with your changes in the "Commit Message" tab
   
 - OPTIONAL: If you are working on a group project make sure to merge your work with main. Hit the Git icon (Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + G), then navigate to remote > origin > main. First, fetch all the files that may have been committed while you were working with the project. Then, right click on main, then hit "Merge 'origin/main' into 'main'"
   
 - After you are done committing, head to the "main" dropdown on the top of your screen
 - You should see a button called "push". Push that button
 - Done!



Part 2: Definitions:

> Branch: Isolated copy of the code for developers to work on without the fear of messing up the code for other developers

> Clone: Duplicating preexisting code onto another device

> Commit: Saving a snapshot of your code

> Fetch: Retrieving data from some greater source

> GIT: Tracks versions of the code and helps teams manage their work better 

> Github: Hosts software development and version controls using GIT, and is a central database of many projects

> Merge: Combining all code into one unified project

> Merge Conflict: When conflicting changes get made to the same file

> Push: Sending new information to a codebase 

> Pull: Requesting information from a preexisting codebase, likely onto ones own codebase

> Remote: Utilizing a different device to complete the same task. I.e., using a laptop to finish a project at home instead of going to an office to work on it there

> Repository: Centralized location used to store, locate, manage, and version control all files in a single codebase
